# jev-use

Voice and typed computer use for macOS. You say what you want. Jev picks the next on-screen action. macOS performs it. No screenshots: the app reads the screen through the Accessibility tree.

## Quick start

Requires macOS 14.2+ and Xcode. No dependencies.

```sh
bash build.sh
open "$HOME/Applications/Desktop Voice.app"
```

In setup: save your TypeSafe API key (stored in the Keychain), then allow Accessibility, microphone and speech.

When setup is complete, Jev shows a small floating panel. Drag its handle to move it. Hold **Control–Space**, speak, release. Jev uses the Mac’s built-in microphone. **Escape** cancels. Or type a command in the widget, or from a shell: `scripts/say.sh "Open Finder"`.

## Examples

- "Open Obsidian, create a new note and type hello"
- "Go to youtube.com, search Rick Astley and play the first video"
- "Open 3 new tabs"
- "Scroll down three times"
- "Tile all the Brave windows so none are stacked"
- "In every Brave window, go to wikipedia.org and search for accessibility" — Jev works out the steps once, code repeats them in each window
- "Close the window", "Save", "New tab" — any item in the app's menu bar

## How it works

One loop, about 0.3–1.5 s per step:

1. **Read.** Walk the front app's Accessibility tree (~120 ms). Every element describes itself: what it is, its name, its value, where it sits, what it can do. No per-app code.
2. **Choose.** One request to Jev (`jev-latest`): the goal, the numbered targets, the last ten actions and their effects. Jev selects an operation and a target. It never generates free text; typed text is a span of your sentence.
3. **Act.** Press, select, type, menu, key, scroll, open, arrange windows.
4. **Check.** Read the screen again. Report the real effect. Repeat until DONE, BLOCKED or WAIT.

Low-confidence and destructive picks stop and ask instead of acting.

## What is sent

To `https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone`: your command, the app and window names, the on-screen targets with their labels and values, and recent actions. Secure text fields are excluded. No screenshots. Speech uses Apple Speech.

Everything is logged locally: `log show --predicate 'subsystem == "local.jev-use"' --last 10m --info`

## Develop

```sh
swift test        # 10 tests
bash build.sh     # quit the app first
```
